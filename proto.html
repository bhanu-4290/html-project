            <h2> EYE CONTROLLED WHEELCHAIR SYSTEM</h2>
            <p>
                The eye-controlled wheelchair system empowers tetraplegic individuals to maneuver independently. Using
                eye movements captured by a webcam, the system utilizes Gaze tracking with OpenCV for precise control.
                Pupil motion determines wheelchair direction, while blinking stops movement. Safety features include an
                ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and automatic halting, all managed by a cost-effective Raspberry
                Pi device.

            <h2> SMART IRRIGATION SYSTEM USING IoT</h2>
            <p>
                The Smart Irrigation System using IoT is an innovative approach that leverages Internet of Things (IoT)
                technology to automate and optimize the irrigation process in agriculture. This system integrates
                various sensors like soil moisture sensors, humidity sensors, and temperature sensors to monitor the
                environmental conditions of the land. By connecting these sensors to a microcontroller like NodeMCU
                ESP8266, the system can collect real-time data and upload it to the cloud for analysis and monitoring.

            <p>
                User Authentication and Authorization: This is the foundation of secure login and registration. User
                authentication verifies the identity of a user attempting to log in, typically using credentials like
                username/email and password
                Booking System: The booking system allows users to reserve and purchase travel services such as flights,
                hotels, car rentals, and tours. It should provide a user-friendly interface where users can search for
                available services, select dates, choose options, and make payments securely.
                Reviews and Ratings: Each service should have a section where users can leave reviews and ratings. These
                should be displayed alongside the service details to help users make decisions.
